# Edie Homepage

This is my solution to the "Edie homepage" challenge on Devchallenges. The project is a responsive, multi-section landing page built from mobile-first approach.

## Key Features

- **Mobile-First Design:** The layout is fully responsive, prioritizing a seamless experience on mobile devices before scaling up to larger screens.
- **Sticky Header:** A fixed header provides consistent navigation as the user scrolls through the page.
- **Multi-Section Layout:** The page includes distinct sections for a hero area, services, a project showcase, and a footer.
- **Modular CSS:** The styling is organized into separate files for each component (`form.css`, `cards.css`, `gallery.css`, `navigation.css`), promoting better maintainability and scalability.
- **Modern Layout Techniques:**
  - **CSS Grid:** Utilized for a photo gallery and a project showcase with a unique staggered alignment effect (acheved with a `translateY()` offset on specific columns).
  - **Flexbox:** Used for flexible and dynamic element alignment, including the two different card layouts.
- **CSS Variables:** Implemented to manage colors, fonts, and spacing, making it easier to maintain a consistent design and allowing for quick theming changes.
- **Contact Form:** A functional email form is included in the footer, featuring custom styling for a sleek look.
